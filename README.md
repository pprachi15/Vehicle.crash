# Vehicle Crash Analysis

This project involves the creation of an interactive Vehicle Crash Analysis dashboard using Tableau for visualization and SQL for data processing. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of vehicle crashes, including total accidents, casualties, and factors contributing to serious casualties.

## Features

The dashboard allows users to filter data based on the current year, previous year, and accident severity. Key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations included in the dashboard are:
- **Total Accidents**: Displays the total number of accidents and the year-over-year (YoY) change.
- **Total Casualties**: Shows the total number of casualties and the YoY change.
- **Fatal Casualties**: Indicates the number of fatal casualties and the YoY change.
- **Serious Casualties**: Presents the number of serious casualties and the YoY change.
- **Slight Casualties**: Displays the number of slight casualties and the YoY change.
- **Serious Casualties by Vehicle Type**: A breakdown of serious casualties by different vehicle types (e.g., cars, buses, bicycles).
- **Serious Casualties by Weather Conditions**: Pie chart showing the distribution of serious casualties based on weather conditions (e.g., fine, rain, snow).
- **Serious Casualties on Road Surface**: Pie chart depicting the distribution of serious casualties based on road surface conditions (e.g., dry, wet, snow).
- **Serious Casualties due to Road Type**: Bar chart illustrating the number of serious casualties based on different road types (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway).
- **Serious Casualties by Location**: A geographical map showing the locations of serious casualties.
